            Accessibility is a team effort. To ensure weâ€™re taking the best
            approach towards being accessible, we had to onboard the whole
            company.

              I'm leading the team focused on end-user experience, overcoming

              I've kick-started design initiatives that support the business,
              such as our UX Services Program. It's a design-led program shared
              with Growth that enables our customers to build the best UX using
              our product. In addition to being a great way to improve our
              product, it drives customer satisfaction and revenue.

            I use Figma and Protopie to design and build prototypes. I use Miro
            to run workshops, and a mix of Notion, Atlassian products and Google
            Suite to write documentation, make sense of data and share work with
            my team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Iâ€™ve got a lot of experience in designing apps on Android, iOS and
            web as well as responsive websites and multi-platform design
            systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            I love talking to our customers, running workshops and research
            projects to make sure weâ€™re building the right thing, in the right
            way.
