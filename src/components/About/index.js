          Iâ€™m a French Senior Product Designer based in London. I love my job
          because I get to empathize with people and be creative to build
          delightful experiences. My leadership style is open, honest, and
          flexible.

          My leadership style is open, honest, and flexible. Iâ€™m a team player
          who thrives in complex situations where empathy and communication are
          the keys to solve the problem. I like to pay attentions to details,
          but I donâ€™t forget to look at the big picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I love learning about art history, psychology, and
          cool cooking trends. On a sunny day, youâ€™ll find me on a long walk,
          listening to a good audiobook..
