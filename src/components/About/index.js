        A bit about me
      </h2>
      <p>
        I’m a French Senior Product Designer based in London. I love my job
        because I get to listen to people and be creative to build experiences
        that improve their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        My leadership style is open, honest, and flexible. I thrive in complex
        situations where empathy and communication are the keys to solve the
        problem. I’m a team player, and I love taking initiatives to challenge
        the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I love learning about art history, psychology, and cool
        cooking trends. On a sunny day, you’ll find me on a long walk, listening
        to a good audiobook.
